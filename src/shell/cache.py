"""A DBus eavesdropper for org.freedesktop.Notifications
interface.

This is created mainly to cache the raw image data that is
sent by stupid applications like Spotify, Discord, etc.
Now that I think about it all of the electron clients do this.

Usually any application, if they had to they'd send the
notifications as a path i.e. caching the image themselves
and then returning the path to it.

Also, <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/>
is a really nice manual. Give it a read.
